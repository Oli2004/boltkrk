# boltkrk
this is just to share some program.


boltkrk.py  is the original still obfuscated version (working).

bolt.py is a cross-platform version modified by me (Works on linux, windows, iphone (tested on my iphone SE), and android).

boltkeker.exe is the original exe version from the official dev of bolt (must have liscense to use or just bypass the auth using https://www.httpdebugger.com/

pyinstxtractor.py is if anyone wants to get .pyc file for some reason. useless since i already shared the decompiled version.

bypass.txt is the file u need to redirect api.auth.gg to, using https://www.httpdebugger.com/
